### **Implementation Details**
#### **HTML (index.html)**
The HTML file serves as the main structure of the website, including headers, sections, and footers. Key elements include:

- **Header**: Contains the logo and navigation menu. On mobile, the menu collapses into a hamburger icon for better usability.
- **Banner**: Two banners (banner1 and banner2) are used to showcase the logo and subscriber count with a cross-fade effect.
- **Videos Section**: Displays videos from YouTube for both Glitch and SMG4 channels, with tab navigation to switch between them.
- **Featured Shows**: Highlights popular shows with images and descriptions.
- **Featured Plushies**: Displays plushie merchandise with images and a call-to-action button.
- **Footer**: Contains the logo and social media links.
#### **CSS**
Three CSS files manage the styling:

1. **styles.css**: Contains the primary styles for the website, including layout, typography, and general styling.
1. **amibo.css**: Contains additional styling specific to the featured plushies section.
1. **responsive.css**: Contains media queries and responsive design adjustments to ensure the website looks good on all screen sizes.
#### **JavaScript**
Two JavaScript files manage the website's interactive features:

1. **script.js**:
- Manages the YouTube API integration for fetching and displaying video data and subscriber count.
- Handles the banner cross-fade effect and animation of the subscriber count.
- Manages tab navigation for the videos section.

- Adds interactive card hover effects in the plushies section.
2. **scroll.js**:
- Utilizes Intersection Observer API to animate elements when they come into view as the user scrolls.
### **API Integration**
The website uses the YouTube Data API to fetch video and subscriber data. Key API interactions include:

- Fetching subscriber count for the Glitch channel and animating the count from zero to the actual number.
- Fetching recent videos for both Glitch and SMG4 channels and displaying them in a grid layout.
- Implementing caching for API responses to reduce the number of API requests and avoid exceeding quota limits.
### **Responsiveness**
To ensure the website is responsive and mobile-friendly, the following steps were taken:

- **Media Queries**: Implemented media queries in responsive.css to adjust the layout for 

  different screen sizes, including collapsing the navigation menu and adjusting grid layouts.

- **Grid Layout**: Used CSS Grid for the plushies section to adapt the number of columns based on 

  the screen size.

- **Flexbox**: Utilized Flexbox for various layout adjustments to ensure elements are properly aligned and spaced.
### **Final Adjustments**
During the final stages of development, several adjustments were made based on feedback:

- Increased the size of plushie images and adjusted their layout to ensure they are well-spaced and properly aligned on mobile devices.
- Fixed issues with the mobile navigation menu, ensuring the hamburger icon is correctly positioned and the menu is accessible.
- Ensured all elements, including banners, videos, and featured sections, are responsive and visually appealing across all devices.
### **Conclusion**
The Glitch website is now fully functional, responsive, and visually engaging. The implementation leverages modern web development techniques to provide a seamless user experience across all devices. The integration with the YouTube API ensures dynamic and up-to-date content, making the website a valuable resource for fans of Glitch
